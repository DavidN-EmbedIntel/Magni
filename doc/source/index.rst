Magni Documentation
===================

:py:mod:`magni` is a Python package developed by Christian Schou Oxvig and Patrick Steffen Pedersen in collaboration with Jan Østergaard, Thomas Arildsen, Tobias L. Jensen, and Torben Larsen. The work was supported by 1) the Danish Council for Independent Research | Technology and Production Sciences - via grant DFF-1335-00278 for the project `Enabling Fast Image Acquisition for Atomic Force Microscopy using Compressed Sensing <http://sip-aau.github.io/FastAFM/>`_ and 2) the Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation - via a grant for a high performance computing system for the project "High Performance Computing SMP Server for Signal Processing".

This page gives an :ref:`sec_introduction` to the package, briefly describes :ref:`sec_how_to_read_the_documentation`, and explains how to actually use :ref:`sec_the_package`.


.. _sec_introduction:

Introduction
------------

:py:mod:`magni` [#magni]_ is a `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ package which provides functionality for increasing the speed of image acquisition using `Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy>`_ (see e.g. [1]_ for an introduction).
The image acquisition algorithms of :py:mod:`magni` are based on the `Compressed Sensing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing>`_ (CS) signal acquisition paradigm (see e.g. [2]_ or [3]_ for an introduction) and include both sensing and reconstruction.
The sensing part of the acquisition generates sensed data from regular images possibly acquired using AFM. This is done by AFM hardware simulation. The reconstruction part of the acquisition reconstructs images from sensed data. This is done by CS reconstruction using well-known CS reconstruction algorithms modified for the purpose. The Python implementation of the above functionality uses the standard library, a number of third-party libraries, and additional utility functionality designed and implemented specifically for :py:mod:`magni`. The functionality provided by :py:mod:`magni` can thus be divided into five groups:

- **Atomic Force Microscopy** (:py:mod:`magni.afm`): AFM specific functionality including AFM image acquisition, AFM hardware simulation, and AFM data file handling.
- **Compressed Sensing** (:py:mod:`magni.cs`): General CS functionality including signal reconstruction and phase transition determination.
- **Imaging** (:py:mod:`magni.imaging`): General imaging functionality including measurement matrix and dictionary construction in addition to visualisation and evaluation.
- **Reproducibility** (:py:mod:`magni.reproducibility`): Tools that may aid in increasing the reproducibility of result obtained using :py:mod:`magni`.
- **Utilities** (:py:mod:`magni.utils`): General Python utilities including multiprocessing, tracing, and validation.

See :ref:`sec_other_resources` as well as :ref:`sec_notation` for further documentation related to the project and the :ref:`sec_tests` and :ref:`sec_examples` to draw inspiration from.

.. _sec_how_to_read_the_documentation:

How to Read the Documentation
-----------------------------

The included subpackages, modules, classes and functions are documented through Python docstrings using the same format as the third-party library, numpy, i.e. using the `numpydoc standard <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_. A description of any entity can thus be found in the source code of :py:mod:`magni` in the docstring of that entity. For readability, the documentation has been compiled using |sphinx|_ to produce this HTML page which can be found in the magni folder under '/doc/build/html/index.html'. The entire documentation is also available as a PDF file in the magni folder under '/doc/build/pdf/index.pdf'.

.. _sec_building_the_documentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

The HTML documentation may be built from source using the supplied Makefile in the magni folder under '/doc/'. Make sure the required :ref:`sec_dependencies` for building the documentation are installed. The build process consists of running three commands:

.. code:: bash

    $ make sourceclean
    $ make docapi
    $ make html

.. note:: 
   In the *make docapi* command it is assumed that the python interpreter is available on the PATH under the name *python*. If the python interpreter is available under another name, the PYTHONINT variable may be set, e.g. "make PYTHONINT=python2 docapi" if the python interpreter is named python2.

Run :code:`make clean` to remove all builds created by |sphinx|_ under '/doc/build'.


.. _sec_the_package:

.. _sec_dependencies:

Dependencies
============

:py:mod:`magni` has been designed for use with |python2|_ >= 2.7 or |python3|_ >= 3.3

.. note::

   The below listed dependency version requirements are the absolute minimum tested versions. Some of these libraries may not work with newer versions of Python unless a newer version of those libraries are used.

**Required** third party dependencies for :py:mod:`magni` are:


- |matplotlib|_ (Tested on version >= 1.3)
- |numpy|_ (Tested on version >= 1.8)
- |pytables|_  (Tested on version >= 3.1)
- |scipy|_ (Tested on version >= 0.14)
- |setuptools|_ (Tested on version >= 11.3)

**Optional** third party dependencies for :py:mod:`magni` are:

- |conda|_ (Tested on version >= 3.7.0) (For automatic metadata capture of a Conda managed Python environment)
- |coverage|_ (Tested on version >= 3.7) (For running the test suite script)
- |ipython|_ (Tested on version >= 2.1) or |jupyter|_ [4]_ (Tested on version >= 1.0) (For running the IPython notebook examples)
- |mkl|_ (Tested on version >= 11.1) (For accelerated vector operations)
- |nose|_ (Tested on version >= 1.3) (For running unittests and doctests)
- |pep8|_ (Tested on version >= 1.5) (For running style check tests)
- |pil|_ (Tested on version >= 1.1.7) (For running the IPython notebook examples as tests)
- |pyflakes|_ (Tested on version >= 0.8) (For running style check tests)
- |radon|_ (Tested on version >= 1.2) (For running style check tests)
- |sklearn|_ (Tested on version >=0.15.1) (For using the scikit-learn logistic regression solver in :py:mod:`magni.cs.phase_transition`)
- |sphinx|_ (Tested on version >= 1.3.1) (For building the documentation from source)

.. [4] The |ipython|_ project has evolved into |jupyter|_. When using Jupyter make sure to install the "full" Jupyter metapackage which includes all Jupyter and IPython components.


.. note:: 

   When using the :py:mod:`magni.utils.multiprocessing` subpackage, it is generally a good idea to restrict acceleration libraries like MKL or OpenBLAS to use a single thread. If MKL is installed, this is done automatically at runtime in the :py:mod:`magni.utils.multiprocessing` subpackage. If other libraries than MKL are used, the user has to manually set an appropriate evironmental variable, e.g. OMP_NUM_THREADS.

You may use the *dep_check.py* script found in the Magni folder under '/magni/tests/' to check for missing dependencies for Magni. Simply run the script to print a dependency report, e.g.:

.. code:: bash

  $ python dep_check.py


.. _sec_tests:

Tests
-----

A test suite consisting of unittests, doctests, the IPython notebook examples, and several style checks is included in :py:mod:`magni`. The tests are organized in python modules found in the Magni folder under '/magni/tests/'. Each module features one or more :py:mod:`unittest.TestCase` classes containing the tests. Thus, the tests may be invoked using any test runner that supports the :py:mod:`unittest.TestCase`. E.g. running the wrapper for the doctests using |nose|_ is done by issuing:

.. code:: bash

  $ nosetests magni/tests/wrap_doctests.py

The entire test suite may be run by executing the convenience script :code:`run_tests.py`:

.. code:: bash

   $ magni/tests/run_tests.py

.. note::

   This convenience script assumes that :py:mod:`magni` is available on the PYTHONPATH as explained under :ref:`sec_installation`.
